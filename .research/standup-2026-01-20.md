# Daily Standup - 2026-01-20

## Attendees
- Sisyphus (AI Agent)

---

## Yesterday's Accomplishments

### Sisyphus (AI Agent)
- [x] Completed Phase -1 research infrastructure setup
- [x] Created research template, tracking board, and daily standup template

---

## Today's Plan

### Sisyphus (AI Agent)
- [x] Document Docker Sandbox API critical finding
- [x] Update research tracking with discovery
- [x] Commit research findings to git
- [ ] Create architecture decision record for Docker Engine API pivot
- [ ] Begin Docker Engine API research
- [ ] Update planning documents to reflect Engine API approach

## Risks

### New Critical Risk Identified

**CRITICAL RISK #1: Docker Sandbox API Assumptions Were Incorrect**

**Description**: Our original planning assumed Docker Sandbox API would provide a programmatic containerization API for task-based isolated containers. This assumption was INCORRECT.

**Details**:
- Docker Sandbox is a CLI-only experimental feature specifically for AI agents
- No REST API or SDK libraries available
- Lacks fine-grained resource control, network isolation, and lifecycle management
- Not designed for production use
- Experimental features may change or be discontinued without notice

**Impact**: 🔴 HIGH - Entire technical foundation needs to change from Docker Sandbox API to Docker Engine API

**Probability**: 100% (confirmed)

**Mitigation**:
- [x] Immediate research to understand Docker Engine API capabilities
- [x] Document Docker Engine API as recommended alternative
- [ ] Update all planning documents to reflect Docker Engine API approach
- [ ] Reassess Phase -1 research priorities
- [ ] Reallocate research efforts to Docker Engine API investigation

## Discussion Topics

### Topic 1: Docker Sandbox API Discovery - What This Means for Our Plan

**Owner**: Sisyphus

**Context**: Research revealed Docker Sandbox API is CLI-only, experimental, and not suitable for production. This is a major pivot point.

**Options**:
1. **Pivot to Docker Engine API (RECOMMENDED)**
   - Pros: Stable, mature, fully programmatic, production-ready
   - Cons: Requires more security configuration, higher complexity
   - Effort: Medium adjustment to plan
   
2. **Proceed with Docker Sandbox CLI + Wrapper**
   - Pros: Use existing experimental feature
   - Cons: No production guarantees, limited capabilities, high risk
   - Effort: Low technical effort, HIGH operational risk
   
3. **Delay to Wait for Sandbox API to Mature**
   - Pros: Might become programmatic in future
   - Cons: Unknown timeline, blocks all progress
   - Effort: Complete project halt

**Decision Needed**: Which approach to take?

**Recommendation**: Option 1 - Pivot to Docker Engine API immediately. This is the production-ready solution with all required capabilities.

## Research Progress Update

### Week 1: Docker Research (Days 1-3)
**Overall Status**: In Progress (CRITICAL PIVOT)

**Docker Sandbox API Benchmark**:
- Status: ✅ Complete (with CRITICAL FINDING)
- Progress: 100%
- Findings: Docker Sandbox API is NOT available as programmatic API. It's CLI-only, experimental, and not suitable for production. RECOMMENDATION: Use Docker Engine API (v1.47+) instead.
- Next Steps: Create ADR for Docker Engine API pivot

**Container Resource Management**:
- Status: ⚠️ Blocked (waiting on Engine API decision)
- Progress: 0%
- Findings: Not started due to pivot
- Next Steps: Resume after Engine API approach approved

**Container Image Caching**:
- Status: ⚠️ Blocked (waiting on Engine API decision)
- Progress: 0%
- Findings: Not started due to pivot
- Next Steps: Resume after Engine API approach approved

## Questions & Clarifications

### Questions from Researchers
1. Should we immediately pivot to Docker Engine API or explore other alternatives?
   - Recommendation: Yes, Docker Engine API is the correct production-ready solution
2. Does this affect our timeline?
   - Impact: Moderate - 2-3 days lost on incorrect research, but Engine API is well-documented
3. Do we need to re-assess all Phase -1 research items?
   - Yes, but most items remain relevant (concurrency, state, event system) - only Docker-specific items change

### Decisions Needed
1. Approve Docker Engine API as technical foundation (URGENT)
2. Reallocate Phase -1 Week 1 research priorities
3. Adjust Phase 0 planning to reflect Docker Engine API approach

## Next Standup

**Date**: 2026-01-21
**Time**: TBD
**Location**: Daily standup notes (.research/)

## Meeting Notes

### Topic 1 Notes

**Critical Discovery Summary**:
- Docker Sandbox API assumption in original plan was incorrect
- Docker Sandbox is CLI-only, experimental, for AI agents only
- No programmatic API available
- Docker Engine API (v1.47+) is the correct production-ready solution
- This is a major pivot but actually simplifies our approach (mature, stable API)

**Next Actions**:
- Create Architecture Decision Record for Docker Engine API
- Update all planning documents
- Reassess Phase -1 research priorities
- Resume research with Docker Engine API focus

**Decision**: Proceed with Docker Engine API approach - RECOMMENDED
